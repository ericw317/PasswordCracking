This program allows you to crack various types of passwords through dictionary attacks and bruteforce attacks.

Currently supported passwords that can be cracked:
- Password protected zip files (only regular zip files at the moment, does not support rar archives yet)

- Hash cracking (NTLM only right now, but more will be added soon)

More to come very soon.
